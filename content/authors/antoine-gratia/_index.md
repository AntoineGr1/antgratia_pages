My name is Antoine GRATIA. I'm a Ph.D. student in artificial intelligence at the University of Namur. My research interests focus mostly on robotics and Deep Learning. I'm currently founded by Ariac project (Applications and Research for Trusted Artificial Intelligence). "ARIAC by DigitalWallonia4.ai" is a project bringing together five French-speaking universities and four approved Walloon research centers (CRAs) with a view to accelerating the development of artificial intelligence technologies in Wallonia. <a href="https://trail.ac/"> Trusted ai labs</a>
